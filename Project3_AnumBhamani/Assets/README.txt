I have used bezier tubes to create the body, tail, and fins of a dolphin. I am using primitive shapes (sphere and cube) to make an eye.
Swappable body parts: 
Body: 3 types
Tail: 3 types
Eye: 2 types
Also, I have created a dolphin with either 0, 1, 2, or 3 fins. 
In total, I have 72 kinds of dolphins
I am also positioning five dolphins randomly in a regular pattern. In total, I have four different sets of positions.
Creature 1: Scaling up if body and tail type is the same
Creature 2: Scaling down if fin and tail type is the same
Creature 3: Scaling down if body and tail type is the same
Creature 4: Scaling up if fin type is zero
Creature 5: no scaling
I have different sizes of bodies and tails.
If I have more time, then I have calculated a specific position to place dorsal fins, and it would be more aligned and give a real look, but I have added other features (mentioned above) like third swappable body part and 72 kinds of dolphin for effort grade. 
Also, I am printing out the types of fish just for the reference.
